#### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

* Description

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n).

Space complexity: O(min(m,n)). m is the size of the HashSet and it's size The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the charset/alphabet m.

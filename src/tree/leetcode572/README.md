#### 572. Subtree of Another Tree

* Description

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n * m). m and n are the number of nodes in the given trees

Space complexity: O(n).

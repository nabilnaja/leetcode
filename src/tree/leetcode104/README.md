#### 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
* Description

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n). n is the number of nodes.

Space complexity: O(h). h is the height of the tree.

#### 572. Subtree of Another Tree

* Description

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(h). h is the height of the tree. the average case would be h = log n, and the worst case n.

Space complexity:  O(h). h is the height of the tree. the average case would be h = log n, and the worst case n.

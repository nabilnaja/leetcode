#### 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

* Description

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(min (n,m)).

Space complexity: O(0).

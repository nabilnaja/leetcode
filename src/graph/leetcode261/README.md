#### 261. Graph Valid Tree

* Description

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.

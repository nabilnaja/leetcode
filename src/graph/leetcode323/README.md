#### 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

* Description

You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n + m).

Space complexity: O(n + m).

* Complexity analysis union find

Time complexity: O(m⋅α(n)). m is the number of vertices and n the number of edges

Space complexity: O(n).

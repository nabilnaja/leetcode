#### 327. Count of Range Sum

* Description

Given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j inclusive, where i <= j.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0
Output: 1

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n log n).

Space complexity: O(n).
